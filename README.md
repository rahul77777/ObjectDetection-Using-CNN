# Near State-of-the-Art results at Object Recognition

In this project,I have tried to implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) for object recognition. More specifically, I will be using the All-CNN network published in the 2015 ICLR paper, "Striving For Simplicity: The All Convolutional Net". This paper can be found at the following link:

In this project, we will learn to:

Import datasets from Keras
Use one-hot vectors for categorical labels
Addlayers to a Keras model
Load pre-trained weights
Make predictions using a trained Keras model
The dataset we will be using is the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

## Obtain Accuracy is 90.88%
